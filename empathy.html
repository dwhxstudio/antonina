    <h1>Empathy in the digital time</h1>
    <p> <strong>Empathy </strong> is important for evolutionary development of humans.</p>
    <em>are we less empathetic when we look at others' suffering online?</em>
    <p>do we feel our bodies when we are on the Internet?</p>
    <p>if we have digital bodies online does it mean that we treat other digital bodies with less respect? </p>
    <p>does my digital body feel pain as my physical body?</p>
    <p>are we as humans more cruel online than in life?</p>
