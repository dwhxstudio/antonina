Hello, everyone!

to me, an online studio is the opposite of Instagram or Facebook, where the platform is praising the posts and ranking them; the algorithm judges the attractiveness of every post, this is why people tend to polish up their thoughts and images. there are conventions on how "successful" pages and accounts should look like.
My studio is a place where I leave traces of thoughts, work in several directions at the same time, and the process of developing ideas and projects is messy and chaotic sometimes. I am also way too judgemental, so my inner critique should be silenced at some stages of my work, otherwise, I will not finish anything.
I see 2 ways how I would like to organise my studio.
the first way imitates a physical space. something like this https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/tillmannohm.github.io/CUDAN-map/map.json
I can see that every room might be a space dedicated to one project, where I would post images, texts, videos, links and other materials. Also, it is possible to make a conference zone to talk to virtual visitors. also, this tool affords to talk to small groups of up to 4 people. this might be something like a digital version of 59 Rivoli, Paris (this is a cultural center made of open studios, the visitors can see both art exhibitions and the process of creating them)
Another way I imagine it is as a cloud of files clustered by a project. something like image embedding https://projector.tensorflow.org/ (choose Mnist with images). to have it something like a universe, a user floats there and able to travel from one project to another. Or it might be like a network of artists, so artworks will be clustered in projects and projects will be put together around their creators.
